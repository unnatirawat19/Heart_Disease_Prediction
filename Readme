# Heart Disease Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients using machine learning techniques. It utilizes a dataset containing various health-related parameters and applies classification algorithms to determine the presence of heart disease.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Feature selection and engineering.
- Application of machine learning models.
- Model evaluation using accuracy and other metrics.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
- Scikit-learn (sklearn)

## Dataset
The dataset contains multiple features such as:
- `age`: Age of the patient.
- `sex`: Gender of the patient.
- `cp`: Chest pain type.
- `trestbps`: Resting blood pressure.
- `chol`: Cholesterol level.
- `fbs`: Fasting blood sugar.
- `restecg`: Resting electrocardiographic results.
- `thalach`: Maximum heart rate achieved.
- `exang`: Exercise-induced angina.
- `oldpeak`: ST depression induced by exercise.
- `slope`: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment.
- `ca`: Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy.
- `thal`: Thalassemia result.
- `target`: 1 (Presence of heart disease), 0 (No heart disease).

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-prediction.git
cd heart-disease-prediction
```
2. Place the dataset (`heart.csv`) in the project directory.
3. Run the script:
```bash
python heart_disease_prediction.py
```
4. The model will train and evaluate performance, displaying metrics and visualizations.

## Model Training & Evaluation
- The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%).
- Machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest are applied.
- Evaluation is done using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Example Prediction
The model takes patient health parameters and predicts:
```
The patient is at risk of heart disease.
```

## Future Enhancements
- Implement deep learning models.
- Improve feature selection techniques.
- Deploy as a web application for real-time predictions.
